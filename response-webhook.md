Use the `/authorization` endpoint to generate a temporary bearer token. The bearer token is used as an authentication mechanism for the API and **expires 15 minutes after creation**. 

URL: `/authorization`

Type: `POST`

Body: 

| Variable     | Type                                                         |

| clientId     | Email or phone number used to authenticate your clinic admin account |
| clientSecret | Password used to authenticate your clinic admin account      |

Response (JSON)

    {
        Status: 'OK',

### **Webhook Configuration**

URL: `/responses/webhook`

Type: `POST`

Headers: Use `authCode` from Step 1 as a [bearer token](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/)

Body:

| Field | **Value**                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| url   | The URL of the webhook endpoint. |

Response:

```javascript
{
	Status: 'OK',
	Response: {
		endpointSecret: The endpointâ€™s secret, used to generatwebhook signatures. Only returned at creation.
	}
}
```



### **Webhook Response**

Webhooks are sent whenever a new response is created or updated within Sympto. Webhooks for responses are guaranteed to be sent **at least once**. On webhook endpoint failure (non-`200` status code), the webhook will automatically retry with exponential backoff over the next <u>3 days</u>

**Headers** 

> Use headers to verify events that Sympto sends to your webhook endpoint.

| **Field**                  | Value                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| X-Sympto-Webhook-Signature | base64 encoded HMAC SHA-256 hash and timestamp (to prevent replay attacks) |



> Sympto generates the timestamp and signature each time an event is sent to your endpoint. If Sympto retries an event (e.g., your endpoint previously replied with a non-`200` status code), then a new signature and timestamp is generated for the new delivery attempt.

Example signature:

```
X-Sympto-Webhook-Signature: t=1492774577,v=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd
```

How to validate signature?

1. Extract timestamp / signatures from the header. 

   Split the header, using the `,` character as the separator, to get a list of elements. Then split each element, using the `=` character as the separator, to get a prefix and value pair.

   The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `v` corresponds to the signature (or signatures). You can discard all other elements.
   
   

2. Use the response body to compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function (with the `endpointSecret` as the key)
   
   

3. Compare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected signature. For an equality match, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.

**Body**

```javascript
{
	Status: 'OK',
	Response: ResponseDataModel JSON,
}
```
